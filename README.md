This project uses 50 melanomas and 50 benign nevi from the ISIC dataset to assess GPT-5's performance for melanoma identification. 

The 100 dermoscopic images were downloaded using script download_isic.py

The melanoma detection of GPT-5 is assessed using OpenAI API interface. Top three differential diagnosis for each image was assessed using script isic_top3_eval.py
